## 💡 Projects

**🏥Healthcare Analytics: Patient Journey & Financial Intelligence**  
Engineered unified analytics platform consolidating fragmented hospital data across 10,000 patient records and $270M in billing volume. Designed three executive dashboards answering critical operational questions: patient demographics, care pathway efficiency, and financial concentration. Identified 18% bed capacity optimization opportunity through length-of-stay standardization and revealed that 10 providers (of 300+) drove 28% of total revenue, enabling targeted contract negotiations. Delivered seasonal forecasting showing 12% March admission surge, transforming reactive staffing into proactive resource planning.

**🛍️Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis: Turkish Retail Intelligence**  
Conducted comprehensive analysis of $28.6M transaction volume across 11,099 customers spanning 796 days of retail activity. Uncovered critical business insight: 16.6% VIP customers generated 67.5% of total revenue with average transactions of $10,507—fundamentally reshaping customer relationship strategy. Identified luxury market segment ($25.7M, 89.9% of revenue) with 32.5% customer penetration, revealing untapped premium positioning opportunities. Documented 26.6% seasonal performance variance between peak (January) and weak (November) months, enabling data-driven inventory and marketing optimization.

**🎯Business Sales Performance Analysis: Multi-Regional Revenue Intelligence**  
Analyzed $70.33M in sales across 25,000 transactions spanning four regional markets and four product categories. Built interactive Power BI dashboard revealing 8.58% month-over-month growth trajectory and 9.22% profit margin. Identified top sales representative exceeding $10M in individual performance—400% above team average—and documented replicable methodologies for organization-wide implementation. Discovered Q4 West region surge and balanced category distribution (Clothing 28%, Furniture 26%), providing strategic foundation for resource allocation and expansion planning.

## ✅Analytical Approach

My methodology combines rigorous statistical frameworks with business pragmatism. I specialize in translating technical complexity into executive-ready insights—whether identifying the Pareto principle in healthcare billing (5 insurers handling 58% of claims), quantifying generational purchasing power indices across customer segments, or calculating cost-per-day normalization to reveal hidden operational inefficiencies.

Every analysis I deliver addresses three core questions: What happened? Why did it happen? What should we do about it? This focus on actionable intelligence—not just descriptive statistics—ensures that insights translate directly to measurable business impact.

## 🏆 Business Value Delivered

- **Operational Efficiency**: 18% capacity optimization in healthcare without infrastructure investment
- **Revenue Intelligence**: Identified customer segments generating 4x average transaction values
- **Strategic Leverage**: Concentrated spend analysis enabling multimillion-dollar contract negotiations  
- **Forecasting Accuracy**: Seasonal pattern recognition supporting proactive resource planning
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Cross-entity comparisons revealing 58% efficiency variances for standardization

## Professional Distinction

What differentiates my work is the intersection of technical rigor and strategic narrative. I don't just analyze data—I ensure every stakeholder from finance to operations pulls from the same governed, trustworthy source. My projects withstand executive scrutiny because they address real business questions with quantified, defensible answers backed by reproducible methodologies.

I excel in environments where analytical precision directly influences strategic decisions, where data quality is paramount, and where insights must be both technically sound and immediately actionable for non-technical leadership.
