## 💡 Projects

**🏥Healthcare Analytics: Patient Journey & Financial Intelligence**  
Engineered unified analytics platform consolidating fragmented hospital data across 10,000 patient records and $270M in billing volume. Designed three executive dashboards answering critical operational questions: patient demographics, care pathway efficiency, and financial concentration. Identified 18% bed capacity optimization opportunity through length-of-stay standardization and revealed that 10 providers (of 300+) drove 28% of total revenue, enabling targeted contract negotiations. Delivered seasonal forecasting showing 12% March admission surge, transforming reactive staffing into proactive resource planning.

**🛍️Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis: Turkish Retail Intelligence**  
Conducted comprehensive analysis of $28.6M transaction volume across 11,099 customers spanning 796 days of retail activity. Uncovered critical business insight: 16.6% VIP customers generated 67.5% of total revenue with average transactions of $10,507—fundamentally reshaping customer relationship strategy. Identified luxury market segment ($25.7M, 89.9% of revenue) with 32.5% customer penetration, revealing untapped premium positioning opportunities. Documented 26.6% seasonal performance variance between peak (January) and weak (November) months, enabling data-driven inventory and marketing optimization.

**🎯 McDonald’s Financial Performance Analysis: Global Profitability & Margin Optimization**
Analyzed $25.5B in global revenue spanning 22 fiscal years to evaluate profitability, growth trajectory, and margin dynamics across business segments. Conducted detailed trend, variance, and CAGR analysis (2.1%), achieving 100% data accuracy through SQL- and Excel-based financial modeling. Automated profitability KPI tracking, cutting analysis turnaround time by 85% (days to hours). Decomposed 34.9pp gross margin expansion (10.8% → 45.7%) and uncovered 8.1% variance in segment earnings linked to leverage efficiency. Delivered insights that informed strategic decisions on cost optimization, pricing adjustments, and operational scalability—providing an executive-level framework for long-term financial planning.

## ✅Analytical Approach

My methodology combines rigorous statistical frameworks with business pragmatism. I specialize in translating technical complexity into executive-ready insights—whether identifying the Pareto principle in healthcare billing (5 insurers handling 58% of claims), quantifying generational purchasing power indices across customer segments, or calculating cost-per-day normalization to reveal hidden operational inefficiencies.

Every analysis I deliver addresses three core questions: What happened? Why did it happen? What should we do about it? This focus on actionable intelligence—not just descriptive statistics—ensures that insights translate directly to measurable business impact.

## 🏆 Business Value Delivered

- **Operational Efficiency**: 18% capacity optimization in healthcare without infrastructure investment
- **Revenue Intelligence**: Identified customer segments generating 4x average transaction values
- **Strategic Leverage**: Concentrated spend analysis enabling multimillion-dollar contract negotiations  
- **Forecasting Accuracy**: Seasonal pattern recognition supporting proactive resource planning
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Cross-entity comparisons revealing 58% efficiency variances for standardization
- **Financial Knowledge**: Analyzed 20+ years Financial Data and recommend stakeholder about investment opportunity
  
## Professional Distinction

What differentiates my work is the intersection of technical rigor and strategic narrative. I don't just analyze data—I ensure every stakeholder from finance to operations pulls from the same governed, trustworthy source. My projects withstand executive scrutiny because they address real business questions with quantified, defensible answers backed by reproducible methodologies.

I excel in environments where analytical precision directly influences strategic decisions, where data quality is paramount, and where insights must be both technically sound and immediately actionable for non-technical leadership.
